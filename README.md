Create a program to compute the gross pay of a certain employee (use AWT or Swing for the components).  Ensure that all exceptions will be handled/declared correctly. Allow the user to input in a TextField and/or ComboBox or other components the following details: Name, nature of work, position and number of hours worked. The nature of work is either field or office. For field work, the employee will get an allowance of 1000. Position of employee is either manager, supervisor or employee. Manager has  a rate of 1000, supervisor has a rate of 700 and employee has a rate of 300.
Use the computation below to compute the gross pay of the employee.
Create a separate class for the following:
Manager
Supervisor
Employee
TestCompute
Gross pay = Rate*Hours Worked + Allowance


Saved all values in a lab5.csv (location at the root directory, use the code above for setting the path) provided by the user with following details:
1. Name
2. Nature of work
3. Position
4. Rate
5. Number of hours worked
